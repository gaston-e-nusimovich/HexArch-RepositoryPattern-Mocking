# HexArch-RepositoryPattern-Mocking

This repo contains a series of C# solutions that illustrate some of the reasons why the **Hexagonal Architecture**, also known as **Ports and Adapters**, offers a better approach than its sibling, the **Onion Architecture**, in terms of **TDD** and mocking.

The point is that the very nature of the **Ports and Adapters** concept lends itself nicely and in a natural and effortless way to philosophy behind **Test-Driven Development** and mocking.
